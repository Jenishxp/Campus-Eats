project:
  name: "Campus Eats"
  tagline: "Smart Campus Food Ordering System"
  description: >
    Campus Eats is a role-based food ordering web application designed for
    college campuses. Students can order food from classrooms or anywhere
    on campus, vendors prepare food in advance, and students collect food
    directly from the canteen. This reduces queues, enables real-time menu
    updates, and promotes digital payments within the campus.
